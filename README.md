# Movie Player 2
Add to my library support for TV shows, which are composed of episodes. Each episode corresponds to a specific file path and can capture custom information, similarly to movies. It should be possible to identify an episode by its sequential number. Then, use interfaces to support multiple implementations of the following domain concepts: something that can be watched (e.g., a movie, an episode, a whole TV show), something that can be binged (watchlists and TV shows), and something that can be preceded or followed by related elements (movies can have sequels and episodes are in a sequence). Add relevant methods to your interfaces to show how they differ, and design your interfaces carefully using the Interface Segregation Principle.

Provide a way to access the elements in any bingeable object, using good design principles. Keep the solution as general as possible.

Add a watchlist generation feature to your Library class. This feature allows client code to automatically generate watchlists based on algorithms specified by the client. For example, a client may want to include create a watchlist of all English movies from a set of studios, or ten random episodes from a TV show. To illustrate your design, use this feature to generate two different watchlists in your Driver code.
